Chapchap
========
Many web application developers face a challenge in creating a decent help system  or knowledgebase
when building their applications. Some are forced to use wikis or online services like Readthedocs. 
Some of these substitutes require the developer to learn a new syntax or dive deep into plugins and extensions.

Chapchap is an app designed to create quick documentation and increase your productivity. Simply categorize your 
content into books e.g. Help Content e.t.c. Under each book, we have chapters. Chapters 
are the topics under each book. Example chapters under Help Content might be Creating an account, Logging in, Verifying your account e.t.c

Under each topic there are articles that are directly related to those chapters. You can create as many books, chapters and articles as you please. Chapchap also sports a JSON API that enables you to load your help content from a remote location. This is especially helpful when 
combined with AJAX methods or PHP's cURL.
